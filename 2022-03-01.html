            Hi, my name is Steve and I'm a recovering <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent-of-Code-aholic</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a software engineer of 25+ years professionally and about 35 years as a hobby. My parents bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20">Commodore VIC-20</a> when I was about 8, and frankly I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
            In those pre-internet days, things came with manuals. As an eager reader, this seemed like heaven to me. I could read a manual which would teach me how to make the computer perform my bidding.
            I quite enjoyed writing programs to generate and solve mazes, which, it turns out, would turn out handy nearly 40 years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            The VIC-20 was a gateway drug and I progressed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_+2A">ZX-Spectrum +2A</a> and then to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">386</a> PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent a lot of time writing clones or interpretations of other games that I couldn't afford to buy and enjoyed the writing as much as the playing the results with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Language-wise, I progressed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> (on the VIC and Speccy) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> on the PC 
            (a revelation... breakpoints, variable watches, much wow.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I also dabbled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80</a> and 386 assembly language to extract more performance from those low megahertz computers, but man, that stuff is not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the halcyon years, I went into programming professionally. Starting with a regression to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)">Visual BASIC</a>.
            Some dalliances with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, most modern (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i">not-so-modern</a>) operating systems and also taking in web technologies in along the way.
            I've also been fortunate enough to come across some interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_jukebox">hardware</a> along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, my weapon of choice is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#/dotnet</a>. I also am happy with most <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">cloud technologies</a>
            and database paradigms that are thrown in my general direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked for small start-ups and multinational corporations and also done some consultancy work and contracting over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess this unintentionally reads a bit like a CV or résumé, but I wanted to give some background as to how I managed to fall down this particular rabbit hole.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.justeattakeaway.com/">Just Eat Takeaway</a>, and this is where the addiction story begins...
