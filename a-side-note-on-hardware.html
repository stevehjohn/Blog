            I have been working on these puzzles on my personal machine which is a high spec 16" 2020 Intel MacBook Pro. I have it dual booted between macOS and Windows so I can switch to whichever suits my current task.
            Usually, Windows for coding and <a href="https://rtypefinal2.com/">gaming</a> and macOS for playing with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/s-h-john/game-of-thrones-metal-wip">music creation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that dotnet is cross platform friendly, I could run the AoC project in <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio</a> in Windows, or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider</a> on macOS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Running the project in either environment produced no discernible difference in performance, so it seems the choice of OS doesn't make much difference to dotnet's use of the bare metal.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, the Intel MacBook specs that matter are:
        </p>
        <pre>
Processor:          Intel Core i9-9980HK
Base Speed:         2.40GHz
Cores:              8
Logical Processors: 16
RAM:                32GB
</pre>
        <p>
            I recently got a work laptop refresh to a 13" M1 MacBook Pro with the following specs:
        </p>
        <pre>
Processor:          Apple M1
Base Speed:         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wbie3lcjiQ">Nobody Knows</a>
Cores:              8 (4 performance, 4 efficiency)
RAM:                16GB
</pre>
        <p>
            I thought it would be interesting, given Apple's bold claims, to see how my code performed on this machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wow.
        </p>
        <p>Execution times for all 343 (7 years &#215; 49, since Christmas day doesn't have a part 2) puzzles:</p>
        <pre>
Intel MacBook Pro: 131,634ms
<span class="inline">M1 MacBook Pro:    113,161ms</span>
</pre>
        <p>
            That's a <span class="inline">14%</span> reduction in execution time on a MacBook that was probably around half the cost of my personal one. Seems Apple may have some substance behind their claims.
