                In my spare time, I've been learning a new skill... developing for Android. I haven't made a mobile app for over 10 years and that was on iOS.
                In the meantime I've mostly been doing C# corporate stuff, so this seemed like a fun diversion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I have submitted the app to Google, and hope it gets the OK for release (can't see why not, it's useful, customisable and does no shady data collection type things.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Until it's released, you can view my empty store front <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=4804281921822895060">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm hoping to charge a small fee, &pound;0.50 for my hard work (believe me, some of it had me pulling my hair out), but these days I think people expect all apps to be free, so I'll see how it goes.
                If no-one buys it, I'll make it free after a while.
            </p>

                A video illustrating some functionality can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH-5vRlUAqU">here</a>.
