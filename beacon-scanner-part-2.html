        Beacon Scanner Part 2

        <p>
            The question posed for part 2 was: what is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan Distance</a> between the two scanners that are furthest apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means finding all the scanners' positions relative to each other, which in turn means we need to determine each scanner's orientation in 3D space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not the easiest thing to reason about, but I didn't think it would challenge me as much as it did.
        </p>
        <p>
            I iterated over this problem more times than I care to admit, and as it was approaching Christmas, quite often with some alcohol inside me. I'll describe the approach that eventually worked for me in this post.
        </p>
        <p>
            At a high level, I arbitrarily decide the first scanner is located at <span class="inline">(0, 0)</span>. All other scanners have a position of <span class="inline">null</span> at this point.
            Then the main routine is basically trying to locate scanner's positions relative to each other. It compares scanners with unknown positions with scanners that have a know position.
        </p>
        <pre>
while (Scanners.Any(s => s.Value.Position == null))
{
    for (var s1 = 0; s1 < Scanners.Count; s1++)
    {
        var originScanner = Scanners[s1];

        if (originScanner.Position == null)
        {
            continue;
        }

        for (var s2 = 0; s2 < Scanners.Count; s2++)
        {
            if (s1 == s2 || Scanners[s2].Position != null)
            {
                continue;
            }

            Scanners[s2].LocateRelativeTo(originScanner);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>
            Okay, reasonable starting point. So, <span class="inline">LocateRelativeTo</span> compares the distances of each scanner's beacons as described in <a href="the-morning-afternoon-after.html">part 1</a>.
            If there are enough matching beacon distances, we know that the scanner's areas overlap and can now try and work out the rest of the puzzle.
