            Anyway, this is going well, I'm having fun with the puzzles and chatting with colleagues in the AoC Slack channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plain sailing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBT7nUxJpC4">blue skies</a>... wasn't struggling with any of the puzzles. May have been neglecting some downtime from the computer though, but hey, if it's fun, it's fun right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Really enjoying the puzzles from both years (but still itching to finish them, so I could fill in the missing 2020 gap.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Then <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15">2021.15</a> dropped.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am writing this a couple of months after the fact, so my memory isn't razor sharp, but I really struggled with this one even though I thought I knew what I needed to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where I had to start using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBtwzTaAY-IWq6Mi1nvwsphMTw-HU13eM">visualisations</a> that would become more sophisticated as I progressed through the puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started with these visualisations to help me reason about the problem:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezjp8jL6hSI">Small data set.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcPOB13PyMM">Large data set.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            But as you can see, especially from the second one, my approach was not going to finish any time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, as I had set myself a performance target, I really didn't want the visualisations to impact the puzzle when not required. This ended up with a lot of conditional compilation, which I wasn't over the moon about.
        </p>
        <pre>
protected int Solve()
{
    var queue = new PriorityQueue&lt;Node, int&gt;();

    queue.Enqueue(_rootNode, int.MaxValue);

    var costs = new Dictionary&lt;int, int&gt;
                {
                    { 0, 0 }
                };
<span class="fade">
#if DUMP && DEBUG
    Console.Clear();

    Console.CursorVisible = false;

    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkGray;
#endif
</span>
    while (queue.Count > 0)
    {
        var node = queue.Dequeue();
<span class="fade">
#if DUMP && DEBUG
        Console.CursorLeft = node.Position.X;

        Console.CursorTop = node.Position.Y;

        Console.Write('█');
#endif
</span>
        if (node.Position.X == _width - 1 && node.Position.Y == _height - 1)
        {
            break;
        }

        foreach (var neighbor in node.Neighbors)
        {
            var cost = costs[node.Position.X + node.Position.Y * _width] + neighbor.Value;

            if (! costs.TryGetValue(neighbor.Position.X + neighbor.Position.Y * _width, out var nextCost) || cost < nextCost)
            {
                costs[neighbor.Position.X + neighbor.Position.Y * _width] = cost;

                queue.Enqueue(neighbor, cost);
            }
        }
<span class="fade">
#if DUMP && DEBUG
        DrawPath(costs);
#endif</span>
    }
}
</pre>
        <p>
            I would solve the conditional compilation issue later on. For now I was focused on getting the puzzles completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a lot of wrong turns, a geeky friend of mine told me to look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a> which I duly implemented (code above.)
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a bit of a revelation and worked a treat as you can see from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVissVcc_EY">this visualisation</a>. Without outputting to the console, the puzzle executes in about 4ms.
