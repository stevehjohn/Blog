            Context switch in our multithreaded process, back to 2021 from 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, it's Saturday, December 18th. Can't really remember what I was up to, but an old friend phoned and he was up for a catch-up and some beer. This was around 8pm.
            I was dubious as from where he lives, he wouldn't get here until 10pm, but my arm was twisted.
        </p>
        <p>
            He turned up around 9:30pm which was a surprise because he's never early, and not a surprise because he, err, doesn't exactly hang around when driving.
        </p>
        <p>
            We started on the beers and indulged in some <a href="https://www.gtomega.co.uk/products/art-racing-cockpit">drunken rallying</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think around 5am while it was his turn to race around the <a href="https://dirtgame.com/dirt5/news/blaze-a-trail">Norwegian countryside</a>, I remembered AoC would have unlocked for that day. Perfect opportunity to get in quick and
            score a higher position on the leaderboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            No chance, this one was a humdinger. Welcome to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19">2021.19</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading through the puzzle (even with my beer and rally addled brain), I thought how interesting this one was. Between turns on the driving rig I found myself pondering the possible solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AoC description covers the puzzle in detail obviously, but the short version is:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You have a bunch of scanners in the ocean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These scanners report back to you a list of beacons they can detect within their sensor range.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The scanners report back the beacon locations relative to the scanner's own position.
                </li>
            </ul>
            And crucially...
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The scanner doesn't know which way it is facing (a bit like me that evening to be honest.)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            That last point means you could have two scanners, in the exact same location, detecting exactly the same beacons, but reporting back two entirely different sets of coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
            What followed was a mixture of drinking, rallying and me and my mate using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule">right hand rule</a> a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we passed out.
