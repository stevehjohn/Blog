            Now, this one has been the bane of my life from an optimisation standpoint.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not a difficult one to comprehend or implement, but everything I did seemed slow in comparison to other puzzle run-times.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried a self-implemented circular linked list, a circular list based upon <span class="inline">List&lt;T&gt;</span>, then simply a <span class="inline">List&lt;T&gt;</span> which I thought got me as far is I could go.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I was at around the ~250ms execution time when I just couldn't see how to make it faster. This was annoying, because it isn't actually doing much... just many repetitions.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Optimisation
        </h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this one doesn't really have a clever optimisation from spotting something in the puzzle that <a href="blizzard-basin.html">didn't need to be done</a> or <a href="pyroclastic-flow.html">finding patterns</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, I went down to the metal and looked at <span class="inline">List&lt;T&gt;</span> to see what it was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="inline">List&lt;T&gt;</span> is basically backed by an array. However, because it is generic, it has to perform many checks on how to determine equivalence, boundary checks, etc...
        </p>
        <p>
            As I knew the size of my array and the type stored, there was no need for these to consume precious processor cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, long story short, I ditched the <span class="inline">List&lt;T&gt;</span> for an array.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the meat of the change.
        </p>
        <pre>
<span class="deleted"><span class="diffSymbol">-</span> private readonly List&lt;Number&gt; _numbers = new();</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> private Number[] _numbers;</span>

...

<span class="deleted"><span class="diffSymbol">-</span> var oldIndex = _numbers.IndexOf(number);</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> var oldIndex = 0;</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span></span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> for (var i = 0; i < _length; i++)</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> {</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span>     if (_numbers[i] == number)</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span>     {</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span>         oldIndex = i;</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span></span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span>         break;</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span>     }</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> }</span>

...

<span class="deleted"><span class="diffSymbol">-</span> _numbers.RemoveAt(oldIndex);</span>
<span class="deleted"><span class="diffSymbol">-</span></span>
<span class="deleted"><span class="diffSymbol">-</span> _numbers.Insert(newIndex, number);</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> if (oldIndex < newIndex)</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> {</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span>     Array.Copy(_numbers, oldIndex + 1, _numbers, oldIndex, newIndex - oldIndex);</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> }</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> else</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> {</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span>     Array.Copy(_numbers, newIndex, _numbers, newIndex + 1, oldIndex - newIndex);</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> }</span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span></span>
<span class="added"><span class="diffSymbol">+</span> _numbers[newIndex] = number;</span>
</pre>
        <p>
            It's difficult to say exactly as the run-times do differ from execution to execution (I thought computers were deterministic...), but I think this shaved ~100ms off the run-time on average.
        </p>
        <p>
            A win, but it's my last remaining puzzle that exceeds 100ms... can I let this go?
