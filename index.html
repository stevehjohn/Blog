            Hi, my name is Steve and I'm a recovering <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent-of-Code-aholic</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a software engineer of 25+ years professionally and approximately 35 years as a hobby. My parents bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20">Commodore VIC-20</a> when I was about 8, and frankly I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
            In those pre-internet days, things came with manuals. As an eager reader, this seemed like heaven to me. I could read a book which would teach me how to make the computer perform my bidding.
            I quite enjoyed writing programs to generate and solve mazes which, it turns out, would come in handy nearly 40 years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time, I was devouring the <a href="https://usborne.com/gb/books/computer-and-coding-books">Usborne</a> coding books, and the magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_(magazine)">Input</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The VIC-20 was a gateway drug and I progressed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_+2A">ZX-Spectrum +2A</a> and then to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">386</a> PC.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent a lot of time writing clones or interpretations of other games that I couldn't afford to buy and enjoyed the writing as much as the playing the results with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Language-wise, I progressed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> (on the VIC and Speccy) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> on the PC
            (a revelation... breakpoints, variable watches, much wow.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I also dabbled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80</a> and 386 assembly language to extract more performance from those low megahertz computers, but man, that stuff is not easy without proper reference
            material (remember, this was pre-internet.)
        </p>
        <p>
            After the halcyon years, I went into programming professionally. Starting with a regression to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)">Visual BASIC</a>.
            Some dalliances with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, most modern (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i">not-so-modern</a>) operating systems and also taking in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">web technologies</a> along the way.
            I've also been fortunate enough to come across some interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_jukebox">hardware</a> during my travels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, my weapon of choice is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#/dotnet</a>. I also am happy with most <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">cloud technologies</a>
            and database paradigms that are thrown in my general direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked for small start-ups, multinational corporations and also done some consultancy work and contracting over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from coding, my other passions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M3">cars</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_Guitars">guitars</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess this unintentionally reads a bit like a CV or résumé, but I wanted to give some background as to how I managed to fall down this particular rabbit hole.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.justeattakeaway.com/">Just Eat Takeaway</a>, and this is where the addiction story begins...

            One of the things I appreciate about <a href="https://www.justeattakeaway.com/">JET</a> is their support of self development, be that through hackathons, training budgets or other initiatives.
            So, I'm not sure how (but probably through a <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> channel), I got wind of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> in early December <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021">last year</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A colleague had set up a private JET leaderboard and started to publicise it within the company.
            It seemed like a very fun thing to get involved with while also maybe learning something along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Little was I to know how deep this rabbit hole would go...

        <p>
            So, having discovered the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> site and being intrigued by the way the puzzles were framed, I found the early ones a nice distraction from my usual "business" coding.
            They seemed to go back to computing basics, and a lot of things that an everyday web developer or back end programmer just doesn't need to think about.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took me back to the things I enjoyed about coding before bills, mortgages, taxes etc... entered into my life!
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, I'm slightly ashamed to admit, I think the fact that there was a leaderboard may have stirred up a latent competitive spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I'd done the first couple of puzzles, I started to get it. <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Eric Wastl</a> obviously puts a large amount of effort into thinking through his puzzles, providing unique input
            for each participant, but also in framing the puzzle with a fun, Christmas themed story.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also realised that I didn't really want to create one or two new console applications every day to participate in this, so a framework was required...
        </p>
        <img src="logo.png" class="fox"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="post">

    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The obvious route (to me, anyway) was to create a base class that puzzle solutions could inherit from. Then, I could have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application">console</a> application that would scan
            the assembly using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming">reflection</a> for concrete implementations of this class, execute them, and check the answer against a text file.
        </p>
        <p>So, this is the base class I came up with.</p>
        <pre>
public abstract class Solution
{
    protected string[] Input;

    public abstract string Description { get; }

    protected Solution()
    {
        var nameSpace = GetType().Namespace ?? string.Empty;

        var parts = nameSpace.Split('.');

        var path = parts.Skip(2).Select(s => s.Replace("_", string.Empty)).ToArray();

        Input = File.ReadAllLines($"{string.Join(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar, path)}{Path.DirectorySeparatorChar}input.txt");
    }

    public abstract string GetAnswer();
}
</pre>
        <p>
            The constructor loads the puzzle input file and makes it available to subclasses via the <span class="inline">Input</span> field. The <span class="inline">Description</span> property is for inheritors to implement to describe the puzzle they are solving. Lastly, surprise surprise,
            <span class="inline">GetAnswer</span> should be used by implementors (i.e. <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveHuwJohn">me</a>) to solve the puzzle and return the answer as a string. So far, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">AoC</a> had only required integer answers but, I've been around the block and kept my options open.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, apart from some timing code (competitive, see?) and some other things added later, the main console app was:
        </p>
        <pre>        
var solutions = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()
                        .GetTypes()
                        .Where(t => t.IsSubclassOf(typeof(Solution)) && ! t.IsAbstract)
                        .OrderBy(t => t.Namespace)
                        .ThenBy(t => t.Name);

foreach (var solution in solutions)
{
    var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(solution) as Solution;
    
    var answer = instance.GetAnswer();

    CheckAnswer(instance.GetType(), answer);
}
</pre>
        <p>
            Where <span class="inline">CheckAnswer</span> would look in a text file for a line formatted <span class="inline">2021.5.1: abc</span> meaning that the answer to 2021, December the 5th, part one was <span class="inline">abc</span>.
            If they didn't match, it will throw an exception.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously, when embarking on each puzzle I didn't know the answer. Once I had the correct answer, I added it to the text file.
            The idea behind this mechanism was to prevent regressions as I anticipated code sharing somewhere down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, my framework was largely in place, I was having fun and... possibly getting a bit cocky.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, now with the framework in place, I could take some time out every day to do a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">code golf</a> of sorts (I wasn't going for the shortest solution... fastest... maybe.)
            Great fun, good mental exercise and, frankly a bit of a change from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic">business logic</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw how quickly my solutions were executing (see console output below) and set myself a goal of having all solutions for the season execute in under one second, combined.

            I really can't heap enough praise on <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Eric Wastl</a> for the effort put into these puzzles, also the colleague who brought this to my attention,
            and the other colleagues who participated in this event. I'm an interminable nerd and this is completely my idea of fun.

            In the chat around this challenge, another colleague mentioned to me that there were previous years (which I hadn't noticed), and one which required you to iterate on a CPU emulator.
            This sounded really interesting to me as it reminded me of some homework I did for a friend who studied computer science at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Computer_Science,_University_of_Bristol">university</a>
            (and who went on to do something completely unrelated to CS.)

        <p>
            So, the multithreading begins.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was the 2019 year that this particular challenge existed, so I started doing that one at the same time... why not?

            I'm not ashamed to admit to a level of OCD. In fact, it's probably what gives me the attention to detail and fastidiousness to be good at my job. It can also be a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pain_in_the_arse">PITA</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having folders in my solution explorer jumping from 2019 to 2021 bothered me. More than it should. First world problems, I know, but it probably drove me to solve the puzzles faster.

        <p>
            And to not embark on another year's ones until the previous ones were completed.

            Anyway, this is going well, I'm having fun with the puzzles and chatting with colleagues in the AoC Slack channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Plain sailing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBT7nUxJpC4">blue skies</a>... wasn't struggling with any of the puzzles. May have been neglecting some downtime from the computer though, but hey, if it's fun, it's fun right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Really enjoying the puzzles from both years (but still itching to finish them, so I could fill in the missing 2020 gap.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Then <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15">2021.15</a> dropped.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am writing this a couple of months after the fact, so my memory isn't razor sharp, but I really struggled with this one even though I thought I knew what I needed to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where I had to start using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBtwzTaAY-IWq6Mi1nvwsphMTw-HU13eM">visualisations</a> that would become more sophisticated as I progressed through the puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started with these visualisations to help me reason about the problem:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezjp8jL6hSI">Small data set.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcPOB13PyMM">Large data set.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            But as you can see, especially from the second one, my approach was not going to finish any time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, as I had set myself a performance target, I really didn't want the visualisations to impact the puzzle when not required. This ended up with a lot of conditional compilation, which I wasn't over the moon about.

            I would solve the conditional compilation issue later on. For now I was focused on getting the puzzles completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a lot of wrong turns, a geeky friend of mine told me to look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a> which I duly implemented (code above.)
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a bit of a revelation and worked a treat as you can see from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVissVcc_EY">this visualisation</a>. Without outputting to the console, the puzzle executes in about 4ms.

            I have been working on these puzzles on my personal machine which is a high spec 16" 2020 Intel MacBook Pro. I have it dual booted between macOS and Windows so I can switch to whichever suits my current task.
            Usually, Windows for coding and <a href="https://rtypefinal2.com/">gaming</a> and macOS for playing with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/s-h-john/game-of-thrones-metal-wip">music creation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that dotnet is cross platform friendly, I could run the AoC project in <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio</a> in Windows, or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider</a> on macOS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Running the project in either environment produced no discernible difference in performance, so it seems the choice of OS doesn't make much difference to dotnet's use of the bare metal.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, the Intel MacBook specs that matter are:
        </p>
        <pre>
Processor:          Intel Core i9-9980HK
Base Speed:         2.40GHz
Cores:              8
Logical Processors: 16
RAM:                32GB
</pre>
        <p>
            I recently got a work laptop refresh to a 13" M1 MacBook Pro with the following specs:
        </p>
        <pre>
Processor:          Apple M1
Base Speed:         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wbie3lcjiQ">Nobody Knows</a>
Cores:              8 (4 performance, 4 efficiency)
RAM:                16GB
</pre>
        <p>
            I thought it would be interesting, given Apple's bold claims, to see how my code performed on this machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wow.
        </p>
        <p>Execution times for all 343 (7 years &#215; 49, since Christmas day doesn't have a part 2) puzzles:</p>
        <pre>
Intel MacBook Pro: 131,634ms
<span class="inline">M1 MacBook Pro:    113,161ms</span>
</pre>
        <p>
            That's a <span class="inline">14%</span> reduction in execution time on a MacBook that was probably around half the cost of my personal one. Seems Apple may have some substance behind their claims.

            As I mentioned, a colleague recommended the 2019 series of puzzles because of the CPU emulation aspect. I'll go into that in a later entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            A puzzle from 2019 that I particularly enjoyed was <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/18">2019.18</a>. A very interesting challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Essentially, you are given a maze as input. The interesting aspect of this puzzle though is that there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-clrKOp5Co">upper- and lower-case</a> characters strewn throughout the maze.
            The uppercase characters represent doors, while lowercase ones represent keys that will open the corresponding door.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your job is to find the shortest path through the maze that unlocks all the doors. I was very intrigued with this one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a visualisation of how I solved the problem, and I'll explain my approach below.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHIyrLsMJns">Advent of Code 2019 Day 18 Part 1</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            So, this is not necessarily a textbook CS approach to it, but it is how I decided to solve it (no doubt biased by my <a href="#the-beginning">maze solving</a> adventures as a child.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I approached the problem in two phases essentially.
            <ul>
                <li>Find the distances between all the doors, keys and the start point (start - 2:23).</li>
                <li>Find the shortest path that opens every door given what was discovered in phase one.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 2 is not really engaging to visualise, so the remainder of the video (2:23 - end) is just the execution of the path that the code found.
        </p>
        <p>
            While visualising using the console as in this video was a useful aid, I wish I'd switched to using <a href="https://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a> earlier for more performant and visually interesting illustrations.
            More on that in a later post I expect.
        </p>
        <h2>Phase 1</h2>
        <p>
            As you may be able to discern in the video, I start a "bot" at each significant point on the map (keys, doors and start point.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of these bots will then try and explore the entire map. They do this by splitting into copies of themselves whenever there is a choice of more than one way to go. Each copy retains the history of the bot that spawned them.
            While in the visualisation this may not look too efficient, it actually completes in ~200ms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hardest problem I faced in this exploration phase was the centre of the map. The maze exploring bots were designed to split at junctions, which is fine. However, the center of the map was an open 3&#215;3 square.
            This caused a massive problem with any bots entering that area just splitting infinitely. I eventually solved this by ensuring each bot not only stores the important cells they had encountered, but their entire history of travel.
            This way, I could prevent a bot from spawning a copy to visit a cell that it had already been to.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of this phase, I now have a list of the routes between all significant points on the map.
        </p>
        <h2>Phase 2</h2>
        <p>
            To be continued... (mainly because it's late and there was actually <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/AoC/tree/master/AoC.Solutions/Solutions/2019/18">quite a lot of code</a> in my solution for this one which I need remind myself of how it works.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I kind of have a policy that code should mostly not need comments if it is well thought out, well structured, good variable names etc... but sometimes, I wish I'd left myself some comments.

            I have coffee and have refamiliarised myself with my own code. Let's continue...
        </p>
        <p>
            So from phase 1 of the implementation, we now have a list of distances between the significant points on the map. I have these stored in a dictionary.

        <p>
            Remember, uppercase letters are doors, lowercase letters are keys and the <span class="inline">@</span> symbol is the starting point in the maze. There are <span class="inline">1378</span> entries in the dictionary, the number
            of combinations of 2 of 53 (<span class="inline">a-z</span>, <span class="inline">A-Z</span>, <span class="inline">@</span>) characters.
            The number is simply the number of steps between the items in any orthogonal direction (up, down, left, right). So, in the above example, there are <span class="inline">5</span> steps between
            the door <span class="inline">W</span> and the key <span class="inline">z</span>.
