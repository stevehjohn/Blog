            I have coffee and have refamiliarised myself with my own code. Let's continue...
        </p>
        <p>
            So from phase 1 of the implementation, we now have a list of distances between the significant points on the map. I have these stored in a dictionary.
        </p>
        <pre>
Wz: 5
Yd: 7
Pr: 7
@e: 18
fx: 20
ay: 22
JK: 16
...
</pre>
        <p>
            Remember, uppercase letters are doors, lowercase letters are keys and the <span class="inline">@</span> symbol is the starting point in the maze. There are <span class="inline">1378</span> entries in the dictionary, the number
            of combinations of 2 of 53 (<span class="inline">a-z</span>, <span class="inline">A-Z</span>, <span class="inline">@</span>) characters.
            The number is simply the number of steps between the items in any orthogonal direction (up, down, left, right). So, in the above example, there are <span class="inline">5</span> steps between
            the door <span class="inline">W</span> and the key <span class="inline">z</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a dictionary of doors between points:
        </p>
        <pre>
Bz: W
iu: N
Zm: K, J
Hr: P, V, I
...
</pre>
        <p>
            So, in the above example, to get to door <span class="inline">H</span> from key <span class="inline">r</span> (or vice-versa), you need to pass through doors <span class="inline">P</span>, <span class="inline">V</span> and <span class="inline">I</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I pass both of these into a <span class="inline">Graph</span> class which, unsurprisingly, constructs a graph of connected nodes from the first dictionary. At this point it just stores a reference to the doors dictionary, it is not
            included in the node graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            This <span class="inline">Graph</span> class is passed into a <span class="inline">GraphSolver</span> class. This class maintains a queue of <span class="inline">INodeWalkers</span> which, like the bots in the discovery phase,
            start at a point and split when reaching a junction. In this case though, we start with one at the maze start point. The queue is a <span class="inline">PriorityQueue</span> so nodes can be added with their distance as the priority,
            and shorter ones will be evaluated first.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may have noticed, this is essentially <a href="#blue-skies">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a> again to some extent. The reason for the extra layers of abstraction will become apparent when I cover part 2 of this puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given that the priority queue evaluates shortest distances first, as soon as an <span class="inline">INodeWalker</span> has visited every key, we can return the number of steps required and answer the puzzle.
            My implementation also returns the path taken, to make the visualisation possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            For part 1 of this puzzle, the <span class="inline">INodeWalker</span> implementation is (drum-roll) <span class="inline">NodeWalker</span>. As mentioned, this is essentially like the discovery bots from phase 1,
            but walks the graph constructed by the <span class="inline">Graph</span> class. It contains some additional logic to check whether a door that hasn't been unlocked exists between two nodes, but that's pretty much it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope I've explained my approach in an understandable manner. I think the <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/AoC/tree/master/AoC.Solutions/Solutions/2019/18">code</a> is quite clean and
            class responsibilities are well delineated. Feel free to provide any constructive <a href="contents.html">feedback</a>.
