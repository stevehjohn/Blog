            The obvious route (to me, anyway) was to create a base class that puzzle solutions could inherit from. Then, I could have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application">console</a> application that would scan
            the assembly using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming">reflection</a> for concrete implementations of this class, execute them, and check the answer against a text file.
        </p>
        <p>So, this is the base class I came up with.</p>
        <pre>
public abstract class Solution
{
    protected string[] Input;

    public abstract string Description { get; }

    protected Solution()
    {
        var nameSpace = GetType().Namespace ?? string.Empty;

        var parts = nameSpace.Split('.');

        var path = parts.Skip(2).Select(s => s.Replace("_", string.Empty)).ToArray();

        Input = File.ReadAllLines($"{string.Join(Path.DirectorySeparatorChar, path)}{Path.DirectorySeparatorChar}input.txt");
    }

    public abstract string GetAnswer();
}
</pre>
        <p>
            The constructor loads the puzzle input file and makes it available to subclasses via the <span class="inline">Input</span> field. The <span class="inline">Description</span> property is for inheritors to implement to describe the puzzle they are solving. Lastly, surprise surprise,
            <span class="inline">GetAnswer</span> should be used by implementors (i.e. <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveHuwJohn">me</a>) to solve the puzzle and return the answer as a string. So far, <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">AoC</a> had only required integer answers but, I've been around the block and kept my options open.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, apart from some timing code (competitive, see?) and some other things added later, the main console app was:
        </p>
        <pre>        
var solutions = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()
                        .GetTypes()
                        .Where(t => t.IsSubclassOf(typeof(Solution)) && ! t.IsAbstract)
                        .OrderBy(t => t.Namespace)
                        .ThenBy(t => t.Name);

foreach (var solution in solutions)
{
    var instance = Activator.CreateInstance(solution) as Solution;
    
    var answer = instance.GetAnswer();

    CheckAnswer(instance.GetType(), answer);
}
</pre>
        <p>
            Where <span class="inline">CheckAnswer</span> would look in a text file for a line formatted <span class="inline">2021.5.1: abc</span> meaning that the answer to 2021, December the 5th, part one was <span class="inline">abc</span>.
            If they didn't match, it will throw an exception.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously, when embarking on each puzzle I didn't know the answer. Once I had the correct answer, I added it to the text file.
            The idea behind this mechanism was to prevent regressions as I anticipated code sharing somewhere down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, my framework was largely in place, I was having fun and... possibly getting a bit cocky.
