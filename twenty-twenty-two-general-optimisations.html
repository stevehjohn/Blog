        I'm sure I thought of more items for this page when lying in bed the other night, but this is what I can come up with at the moment...
        <h2>
            Caching / Memoisation
        </h2>
        <p>
            I don't recall having used this in previous years, but I may be wrong. It did make a big difference to at least one puzzle this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use cases I can think of (though there may well be more):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Storing a reasonably expensive state to generate, that will likely be required again. The second time it can just be looked up rather than calculated.
                </li>
                <li>
                Storing the output from a deterministic function or method and keying it on the parameters passed in.
                See <a href="">this method</a>.
                <pre>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Data Types
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is C# specific, though the collections can have similar/wildly different names across languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you don't care about order, use a <span class="inline">HashSet&lt;T&gt;</span> rather than a <span class="inline">List&lt;T&gt;</span>, <span class="inline">T[]</span> or whatever. Should be much faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quite specific to some puzzles, but if the "arena" is small enough and the use case supports it, store the values as bits.
                    Convoluted example, but if a cell has 2 states and the arena is 1 x 64, that can be accommodated in a <span class="inline">ulong</span> rather than <span class="inline">byte[64]</span> or <span class="inline">char[64]</span>.
                    Less state data to copy if required. Also, bit manipulation techniques can be used for comparisons/moves, which will be super fast.
                    I've definitely used this to good effect in at least a few puzzles.
                    E.g. for storing opened valves in <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/AoC/blob/0e94e848ab3566e486645fd0ab5356d43cf9ca66/AoC.Solutions/Solutions/2022/16/Part1.cs#L33">day 22</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
