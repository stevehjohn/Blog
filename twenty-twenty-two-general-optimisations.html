        I'm sure I thought of more items for this page when lying in bed the other night, but this is what I can come up with at the moment...
        <h2>
            Caching / Memoisation
        </h2>
        <p>
            I don't recall having used this in previous years, but I may be wrong. It did make a big difference to at least one puzzle this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use cases I can think of (though there may well be more):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Storing a reasonably expensive state to generate, that will likely be required again. The second time it can just be looked up rather than calculated.
                </li>
                <li>
                Storing the output from a deterministic function or method and keying it on the parameters passed in.
                See <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/Blog/blob/c1a75f26fed34266d962c4f2c241ac30d94b42ba/AoC.Solutions/Solutions/2022/24/Base.cs#L236">this method</a>.
                <pre>
No memoisation: 

  2022 24.1: 401ms   Blizzard basin
  2022 24.2: 831ms
             -------
             1232ms

Memoisation:

  2022 24.1: 241ms   Blizzard basin
  2022 24.2: 495ms
             -------
             736ms
</pre>
            </ul>
            UPDATE: I have since optimised the solution for that puzzle, that the memoisation is no longer helpful, but at the point in time linked above, it made a difference.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Data Types
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is C# specific, though the collections can have similar/wildly different names across languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you don't care about order, use a <span class="inline">HashSet&lt;T&gt;</span> rather than a <span class="inline">List&lt;T&gt;</span>, <span class="inline">T[]</span> or whatever. Should be much faster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quite specific to some puzzles, but if the "arena" is small enough and the use case supports it, store the values as bits.
                    Convoluted example, but if a cell has 2 states and the arena is 1 x 64, that can be accommodated in a <span class="inline">ulong</span> rather than <span class="inline">byte[64]</span> or <span class="inline">char[64]</span>.
                    Less state data to copy if required. Also, bit manipulation techniques can be used for comparisons/moves, which will be super fast.
                    I've definitely used this to good effect in at least a few puzzles.
                    E.g. for storing opened valves in <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/Blog/blob/0e94e848ab3566e486645fd0ab5356d43cf9ca66/AoC.Solutions/Solutions/2022/16/Part1.cs#L33">day 22</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Compiler Hints
        </h2>
        <p>
            Again, C# specific though other languages might have equivalents. Sometimes (and I mean, not very often in my experience), the compiler hints for methods <span class="inline">[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveOptimization)]</span>
            and/or <span class="inline">[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]</span> can speed things up. I'm guessing the fact that it only rarely helps is why the compiler doesn't do it all the time for everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the next few posts, I'll dive into some optimisations I discovered specific to particular puzzles. They will be in the order that they pop into my head...
