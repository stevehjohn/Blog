        <p>
            So, I refactored (basically re-wrote) <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/ZXE">ZXE</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wasn't sure whether I wanted to or not, then just ended up doing it. Wasn't 100% happy with ZXE as I learned lessons along the way which
            would have made me do many things differently if I'd known them at the start.
        </p>
        <p>
            This new version is called <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/Zen">Zen</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm much happier with the general architecture of this version, though there's still some things I think I rushed and would do differently
            if I started again.
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="Game Screenshots/Old Tower.PNG"/>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            I knew the video emulation on ZXE wasn't perfect as I hadn't put much thought into it. It showed in titles like Batman The Movie,
            where there was noticeable screen tearing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chatting on the ZX Spectrum #emulation Discord channel, a further challenge presented itself. Games like Old Tower (pictured above)
            can use clever techniques to create effects not thought possible on the Speccy.
