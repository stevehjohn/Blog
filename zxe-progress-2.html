            So, this could turn out to be quite the series of blog posts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having done a bunch of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> puzzles and a friend's computer science homework that involved "emulating" a machine, I had the crazy idea the other day to write a proper emulator myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Easy-peasy, right? If you really boil it down to the basics (ignoring many great features of modern languages) an emulator is essentially, at it's core a big <span class="inline">switch</span> statement...
            right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Short answer: No.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, there is a massive difference between implementing a well thought-out theoretical virtual machine and emulating a processor designed in the 1970s.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, because I'm a glutton for punishment, I cracked on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I discussed testing in my <a href="zxe-progress.html">previous post</a>, so I won't go there again. For now, anyway. I guess I just want to post about some other details related to implementing something like this.
        </p>

            Tedium... 
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have always been passionate about coding, and probably always will be. When I'm creating something with code and in the flow, time seems to slip away. However...
        </p>
        <p>
            Churning through a massive list of instructions to emulate, each with details such as setting flags after the operation etc... has become a bit of a grind.
