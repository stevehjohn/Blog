            Well, I've been quite enjoying working on this emulator.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing nagging at me while doing so was, "how do I test this thing?" Doing a complete implementation and then loading a game into it hoping it would work would just be ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p>
            It took a fair bit of Googling, braving asking a question on the now toxic Stack Overflow (no joy) and some more Googling to find something useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I came across <a href="https://github.com/raddad772/jsmoo">JSMoo</a> on GitHub. A JavaScript/AssemblyScript multiple machine emulator. 
            Specifically, <a href="https://github.com/raddad772/jsmoo/tree/main/misc/tests/GeneratedTests/z80">this part</a> of the project was going to prove extremely useful to me.
            It is a lot of JSON files (~1,600) each containing multiple tests. Each file targets a specific instruction. 
            The test provides a starting machine state and an expected machine state once the instruction(s) have been executed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, at this point I have implemented 175 instructions in my Z80 processor class. When I first found this test suite, about 20% of them failed the given tests.
            Imagine not having these tests and trying to track down what is wrong when attempting to run something on the emulator! Virtually impossible I reckon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, at the time of writing this, all instructions pass all the tests thrown at them. I'm looking forward to getting everything implemented and see if I can get a booting 48K Speccy running.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also implemented a test runner that will output debug information for failing tests.
        </p>

                <img src="Images/Debugging-Test-Suite.PNG" />
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            And if there are differences in expected RAM contents...
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="Images/Debugging-Test-Suite-2.PNG" />
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Which is pretty handy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the result of running the test suite at the moment.
