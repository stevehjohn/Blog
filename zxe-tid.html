            A bit more progress to report. Been unwell, so not done a huge amount this week.
        </p>
        <p>
            The emulator boots, and once at the copyright screen, I can press <span class="key">F10</span> and it will load a <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/z80format.htm">Z80</a> image 
            which I have hard-coded for now to be Treasure Island Dizzy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because childhood memories I guess.
        </p>

            Actually, definitely childhood memories... I used to play this game all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway... 
        </p>
        <p>
            The emulator is obviously doing a lot of things correctly to get to this stage after loading the memory snapshot.
        </p>
        <p>
            But...
        </p>
        <p>
            Dizzy's hands aren't wobbling which they should (which I interpret as something having stalled). Also I have not implemented keyboard input for the emulator yet, so sadly no movement for the pre-omelette.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how it should be in all its glory... (beware, the sound is much more annoying than I recall).
        </p>

            All in all, this has been quite a fun personal challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            I fully admit to starting it thinking it would be a piece of the proverbial. With hindsight though, emulating an entire computer system is not trivial at all.
            It is not just a case of replicating all the processor instructions to manipulate RAM.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, this has been an interesting passion project. If anyone wants to chip in, especially with regards to interrupts, <a href="https://github.com/stevehjohn/ZXE">please do</a>.
